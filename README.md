# ELECTRICITY-BILLING-SYSTEM-USING-JAVA
The Electricity Billing System using Java is an efficient and user-friendly solution
designed to automate the billing process for electricity consumption. In today's
fast-paced world, managing and calculating electricity bills manually can be errorprone and time-consuming. This mini project presents a software application
developed in Java, aimed at simplifying the billing process for both consumers and
utility service providers.
The system allows consumers to register their electricity connections, view their
consumption history, and receive accurate and transparent bills based on their
usage. It also enables utility service providers to manage customer data, meter
readings, and generate bills seamlessly. The project employs Java programming
language and utilizes object-oriented principles to ensure modularity,
maintainability, and scalability.
