# ELECTRICITY-BILLING-SYSTEM-USING-JAVA
The Electricity Billing System using Java is an efficient and user-friendly solution
designed to automate the billing process for electricity consumption. In today's
fast-paced world, managing and calculating electricity bills manually can be errorprone and time-consuming. This mini project presents a software application
developed in Java, aimed at simplifying the billing process for both consumers and
utility service providers.
The system allows consumers to register their electricity connections, view their
consumption history, and receive accurate and transparent bills based on their
usage. It also enables utility service providers to manage customer data, meter
readings, and generate bills seamlessly. The project employs Java programming
language and utilizes object-oriented principles to ensure modularity,
maintainability, and scalability.

Key Features:
1. User Registration: Consumers can register their electricity connections by
providing necessary details such as name, address, and meter number,
ensuring a systematic record of customers.
2. Meter Reading Management: The system allows utility service providers to
record and update meter readings periodically. These readings are used to
calculate the electricity consumption of individual consumers.
3. Billing Calculation: The application automates the process of calculating
electricity consumption based on meter readings, tariff rates, and other
relevant parameters. It ensures accurate and error-free billing.
4. Bill Generation: The system generates detailed electricity bills for consumers,
including usage details, tariff rates, applicable taxes, and total amount
payable. Bills are generated automatically and can be accessed by consumers
online.
5. Usage History: Consumers can view their historical electricity consumption
data, allowing them to track their usage patterns over time. This feature
promotes awareness and encourages energy conservation.
6. User Authentication and Security: The system incorporates user
authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access. Consumer data is
protected to maintain confidentiality and privacy.
