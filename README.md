# Electricity Billing System Using Java

## Introduction
The **Electricity Billing System** is a Java-based software application designed to automate the electricity billing process for both consumers and utility service providers. The system enhances efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in calculating and generating electricity bills based on consumption data.

## Features
- **User Registration:** Consumers can register their electricity connections by providing details such as name, address, and meter number.
- **Meter Reading Management:** Utility providers can record and update meter readings periodically.
- **Billing Calculation:** The system calculates electricity consumption based on meter readings, tariff rates, and other factors.
- **Bill Generation:** Automated generation of detailed bills including usage, tariff rates, taxes, and total payable amount.
- **Usage History:** Consumers can view historical electricity consumption data.
- **User Authentication & Security:** Secure login system for both consumers and service providers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java (Object-Oriented Programming principles)
- **Database:** MySQL (or any other relational database)
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing / JavaFX (for desktop UI)
- **Web Framework (Optional):** Spring Boot (if implementing as a web app)

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/electricity-billing-system.git
   cd electricity-billing-system
   ```
2. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Install MySQL and create a database (e.g., `electricity_billing`).
   - Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) to create required tables.
   
3. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Update database credentials in `config.properties` file:
     ```properties
     db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/electricity_billing
     db.user=root
     db.password=yourpassword
     ```
4. **Compile & Run the Application:**
   ```sh
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Usage
- **Consumers:** Register, log in, and view electricity bills.
- **Utility Providers:** Record meter readings and generate bills.
- **Admin:** Manage user accounts and oversee the system.

## Future Enhancements
- **Online Payment Integration** (Pay bills via payment gateways)
- **SMS/Email Notifications** (Bill alerts and reminders)
- **Mobile App Support** (Android/iOS compatibility)
